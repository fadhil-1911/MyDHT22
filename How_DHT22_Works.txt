Here are the **detailed steps of the DHT22 sensor reading process**:

---
[ Start ]
   |
   v
[ MyDHT22::readData() ]
   |
   v
[ Clear data buffer (5 bytes) ]
   |
   v
[ Send start signal to DHT22 ]
   - Set pin as OUTPUT
   - Pull pin LOW for ≥1ms
   - Pull pin HIGH for 30µs
   - Switch pin to INPUT mode
   |
   v
[ Wait for DHT22 response ]
   - Expect: LOW (~80µs), HIGH (~80µs), LOW (~80µs)
   |
   +--> (❌ Timeout at any stage?) --> [ Return false ]
   |
   v
[ Read 40 bits of sensor data ]
   - For each bit:
       - Wait for pin to go HIGH
       - Measure how long it's HIGH
           - >40µs → bit = 1
           - ≤40µs → bit = 0
       - Store bit into `data[0..4]`
   |
   v
[ Validate checksum ]
   - Sum of data[0] + data[1] + data[2] + data[3]
     must equal data[4]
   |
   +--> (❌ Invalid checksum?) --> [ Return false ]
   |
   v
(✅ Valid) --> [ Return true ]

-------------------------------
 Accessor Functions:

[ getHumidity() ]
   → Combine data[0] and data[1]
   → Multiply by 0.1
   → Return as %RH

[ getTemperature() ]
   → Combine data[2] and data[3]
   → Check sign bit (bit 15 / data[2] & 0x80)
   → Multiply by 0.1
   → Return as °C

## **Steps for Reading Data from DHT22 Sensor**

### **1. Initialization**

* Configure the data pin connected to DHT22 as **input with pull-up**.
* Prepare a **buffer (5 bytes)** to store the 40 bits (humidity, temperature, checksum).

---

### **2. Start Signal (Request from MCU to DHT22)**

* Set the data pin to **OUTPUT** mode.
* Pull the pin **LOW for at least 1 ms** (usually \~1–20 ms).
* Pull the pin **HIGH for 20–40 µs**.
* Set the pin to **INPUT** mode to wait for the sensor response.

---

### **3. Sensor Response**

* DHT22 responds with the following sequence:

  * **LOW for \~80 µs** (acknowledgment start).
  * **HIGH for \~80 µs** (ready to send data).
* If any of these are missing or delayed (timeout >90 µs), the read fails.

---

### **4. Data Transmission (40 Bits Total)**

* The DHT22 sends **40 bits**:

  * **16 bits for humidity** (integer and decimal parts).
  * **16 bits for temperature** (integer and decimal parts).
  * **8 bits checksum**.

* For **each bit** (repeated 40 times):

  1. DHT22 pulls the line **LOW for \~50 µs** to signal a new bit.
  2. Then it pulls the line **HIGH**.

     * If HIGH lasts **\~26-30 µs**, the bit is `0`.
     * If HIGH lasts **\~70 µs**, the bit is `1`.

---

### **5. Store the Data**

* Store each bit into the correct position in the 5-byte data buffer.
* Use bit manipulation to insert bits into bytes.

---

### **6. Verify the Checksum**

* Calculate checksum:
  `checksum = data[0] + data[1] + data[2] + data[3]`
* Compare with `data[4]` (received checksum).
* If they match, the data is **valid**. Otherwise, **discard** the result.

---

### **7. Extract Humidity and Temperature**

* **Humidity** = `(data[0] << 8) | data[1]` × 0.1 (%RH)
* **Temperature**:

  * Get raw value: `(data[2] & 0x7F) << 8 | data[3]`
  * Multiply by 0.1
  * If `data[2] & 0x80` is set, temperature is negative.
